                    At 10 to 12 inches at the shoulder and 27 to 30 pounds, a well-built male Pembroke presents a big dog in a small package. Short but powerful legs, muscular thighs, and a deep chest equip him for a hard day’s work. Built long and low, Pembrokes are surprisingly quick and agile. They can be red, sable, fawn, and black and tan, with or without white markings.
                    The Pembroke is a bright, sensitive dog who enjoys play with his human family and responds well to training. As herders bred to move cattle, they are fearless and independent. They are vigilant watchdogs, with acute senses and a “big dog” bark.
                     Families who can meet their bold but kindly Pembroke’s need for activity and togetherness will never have a more loyal, loving pet.
                     <br><br>
                     The Pembroke Welsh Corgi should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval.
                      Any diet should be appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior).
                       Some dogs are prone to getting overweight, so watch your dog’s calorie consumption and weight level. Treats can be an important aid in training, but giving too many can cause obesity. Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs, and which are not.
                      Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog’s weight or diet. Clean, fresh water should be available at all times.
                      <br><br>
                      The Pembroke has a thick, weatherproof double coat—a soft, light undercoat covered by a coarse outer coat. The breed sheds a fair amount on a daily basis, and even more so in the late spring/early summer.
                       A daily once-over with a comb and a slicker brush will remove a lot of the shed hair before it is all over the house.
                        During shedding season, baths help to loosen the dead hairs—the dog must be completely dry before brushing begins—and a rake helps strip out the undercoat.
                       As with all breeds, the Corgi’s nails should be trimmed regularly, and ears checked to be sure they are clean and healthy.
                       A strong, athletic little dog developed to herd cattle and other livestock, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi loves physical activity and is happiest when he has a job to do. Corgis benefit from moderate daily exercise to maintain their physical and mental health. Pembrokes can do well on long walks or slow jogs, but their short legs won’t allow them to keep up with a bicycle rider. Avoid extreme heat or cold, and always provide plenty of cool, fresh water after exercise. Many Pembrokes enjoy and excel at canine activities such as agility, herding, obedience, and tracking events.

                        As with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are strongly recommended.
                         Gently exposing the puppy to a wide variety of people, places, and situations between the ages of 7 weeks and 4 months will help him develop into a well-adjusted, well-mannered adult. Pembrokes often have a mind of their own, but they are energetic, willing, and highly intelligent partners who respond well to training.
                        Positive, reward-based training works best with this sensitive breed.
                        <br><br>
                        The Pembroke is typically a healthy breed, and responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as elbow and hip dysplasia, eye disorders, cardiac issues, degenerative myelopathy, and von Willebrand’s disease, a bleeding disorder.
                         As with all breeds, a Pembroke’s ears should be checked weekly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed regularly.

                <p id="responsive">Welsh Corgis have historically been used as herding dogs, specifically for cattle. 
                    They are of the type of herding dog referred to as "heelers", meaning that they would nip at the heels of the larger animals to keep them on the move
                    The combination of the low height off the ground and innate agility of Welsh Corgis would allow them to avoid the hooves of cattle.The term "Corgi" means either cur dog or dwarf dog 
                    which was not intended as an insult to the dog's size, rather as a purely descriptive term. 
                    There is also a folk legend that says Corgis were a gift from the woodland fairies, and that the breed's markings were left on its coat by fairy harnesses and saddles.
                    <br><br>
                    The Cardigan Welsh Corgi has been attributed to the influences of Nordic settlers in the region.
                     Dogs of similar dimensions exist in modern Scandinavia, called the Swedish Vallhund,and it is claimed by some historians that these two breeds share a common ancestor.
                     Farmers in Cardiganshire began to switch from cattle to sheep in the late 19th century, but the existing breed was unsuited to working the sheep flocks. 
                    The dog began to be crossed with the Welsh Sheepdog, and this is the source of the merle colour pattern in the breed.
                    <br><br>
                    The first recorded date for Corgis appearing in the show ring in Wales is 1925. Captain J. P. Howell called together a meeting of breeders of both the Pembroke and the Cardigan varieties, and formed the Welsh Corgi Club, with an initial membership of 59 members.
                     A general breed standard was drawn up, and Corgis began to appear in conformation shows. 
                     <br><br>There are two breeds of Welsh Corgis, the Cardigan and the Pembroke, each named for the county in Wales where it originated. The dogs share several similar traits, such as their coats, which are water resistant and shed on average twice a year. 
                        The body of the Cardigan is slightly longer than that of the Pembroke; both breeds have short legs, placing their bodies close to the ground.
                     But they are not as square in outline as a typical Terrier, or have an elongated body as great as that of a Dachshund. There are only minor differences in the shape of the head, both appear fox-like. The head of a Cardigan Welsh Corgi is typically larger than that of an equivalent Pembroke, and has a larger nose.
                      It can take a few days following birth for the true colour of a Corgi's coat to appear, and this is particularly evident in those with tricolour or black and tan markings.
                      The differences between the two breeds include bone structure, body length, and size. Cardigans are the larger of the two breeds, with large rounded ears and a 12-inch-long (30 cm) fox-like, flowing tail set in line with the body. Though the Cardigan is allowed more colours than the Pembroke, white should not predominate in its coat.The Cardigan is a double-coated dog where the outer coat is dense, slightly harsh in texture, and of medium length. The dog's undercoat is short, soft, and thick.
                       According to the breed standard, the breed stands between 10.5–12.5 inches (27–32 cm) at the withers, and should weigh between 30–38 pounds (14–17 kg). The skeletal structure of the Cardigan differs from the Pembroke, in that there is a more exaggerated bend in the front two legs, which fits around the ribcage of the animal. In addition, the Cardigan is more heavily set than the Pembroke, with denser bone mass

                <p id="responsive">According to the Kennel Club Purebred Dog Health Survey conducted in 2004, the two breeds had similar average lifespans: the median age at death was 12 years 3 months for Pembrokes, and 12 years 2 months for Cardigans.
                     The main causes of death were similar in both breeds: the primary causes were canine cancer and old age. 
                     However, the Pembroke breed showed a higher proportion of deaths attributed to either kidney failure or a urethral obstruction
                        <br>
                        The survey showed that the breeds suffer from similar rates of ongoing health conditions, with one exception. Whereas more than a quarter of Pembroke Welsh Corgis surveyed suffered from some type of eye condition, only 6.1% of the Cardigan Corgis did.Eye conditions typical in the Corgi breeds include progressive retinal atrophy, which occurs more often in dogs over six years of age, and canine glaucoma, which again is more common in older dogs.
                        Progressive retinal atrophy in corgi is treatable by changing the lens of the broken lens.
                         Similar percentages in the survey were seen in both breeds for issues relating to reproduction, such as requiring caesarian sections and having false pregnancies.
                         Further similarities were also seen related to musculoskelatal issues, including arthritis.However,
                          Hip dysplasia, common in some types of dogs, is rare in the Corgi breeds.
                        <br><br>
                        Perhaps the most common Corgi health issue is their tendency to become obese. Due to their dwarf frames with long bodies and tiny legs, gaining extra weight can be extremely difficult for Corgis to deal with and can lead to a variety of other health problems.
                         Corgis will always want more food, but it is important to keep them on a routine, healthy diet to ensure they don’t gain excess weight.
                        It is very easy for a Corgi to gain weight, and it should be closely monitored. A pound or two may not seem like much, but it is actually a huge difference when you consider their total weight.
                        If you have a 22-pound Corgi that gains two pounds to 24, that is actually nine percent gain in their total weight.
                        Don’t let your Corgis expressive eyes and convincing begging convince you that they are hungry. 
                        They just love food. If your Corgi is prone to gaining weight, talk with your veterinarian to come up with a more healthy diet and routine exercise to keep your Corgi healthy and live a longer life.

                <p id="responsive">Welsh Corgis come in two varieties: the Pembroke and the Cardigan.
                     They were registered as one breed by the Kennel Club in the U.K. until 1934, although many breeders believe the two breeds developed separately.
                      Both have similar heads, bodies, levels of intelligence and herding ability, but the Cardigan is slightly larger and heavier boned than the Pembroke.
                       For most of us, the easiest way to tell the difference between a Pembroke and a Cardigan is to look at the tails. Pembrokes' are docked and Cardigans' are long. 
                       <br><br>
                       Pembrokes are vocal dogs that have a tendency to bark at anything and everything.
While they are intelligent dogs, they also can be stubborn. If housebreaking is a problem, crate training is advised.
Their strong herding instinct may cause them to nip at the heels of children when they are playing.
Pembrokes are prone to overeating. Their food intake should be monitored closely.
Even though they are small dogs, Pembrokes have a lot of energy and need a healthy amount of exercise each day.
To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store.
 Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
<br>
Pembroke Welsh corgis are known for their quick intelligence and forceful will. 
They are active, animated dogs and do not ever want to be left out of the action. In their own minds, they are big dogs in small bodies.
These dogs still handle livestock much larger than they are, and to do so use speed, a quick nip and sheer determination.
 As all-around farm dogs, corgis undoubtedly hunted vermin and guarded the homestead as well as herding livestock. 
 Corgis need exercise and training with a firm but kind hand to make the most of their talents. <br>
Corgis can be prone to excessive alarm barking and to digging or chewing if left alone too much or not exercised enough. 
They want to be part of the family and do not do well left in kennels. Most corgis are fine with other pets and children if they have been raised with them.
 Beware that they will sometimes chase and nip at the heels of small running children because of their herding instincts.
 <br>Although Pembrokes are still used as working dogs, they are most often seen as family pets these days. 
 They are known for being happy, loving, and intelligent, but with a stubborn or independent streak at times. 
 They are easy to train, but don't expect your Pembroke to be subservient. They like to think for themselves
 . Although they want to please their owners, food is a great motivator for them when training
 . Proceed with caution: Pembrokes love to eat and can become obese if their food intake isn't moderated. Pembrokes also make good watchdogs.
  They can be suspicious of strangers, and will be quick to bark if they feel that something or someone is threatening their home and family. 
  Like every dog, the Pembroke needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young.
   Socialization helps ensure that your Pembroke puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.

                    They require only a quick, weekly grooming except in times of shedding. They need to be watched carefully for developing obesity. 
                    These dogs are easy to keep and do well with a minimal amount of food. Added weight can be an extra strain on the long, low back.
                    Exercise is a must, both for mental health and to keep the weight under control.
                     Corgis are people oriented and thus love to work with them and enjoy training.
                      Despite their appearance, these are athletic little dogs that excel in herding and agility competitions. 
                      They are quick to learn tricks and seem to have a sense of humor. They are excellent watchdogs, if anything prone to unnecessary alarm barking.
                    Perhaps because of their small stature, corgis seem to be attracted to high places and may occasionally be found on the back of the sofa or in the middle of the kitchen table. Corgis do need a firm but kind hand in training. 
                    If left to their own devices, they can be manipulative and will take charge themselves.
                    <br>
                    Corgis in general are not prone to separation anxiety when you are out of the home (any dog can develop this, but some breeds are more prone than others).  However, when you are home your Corgi will want to be with you.  Most Corgis don’t like being left in a yard alone.  
                    They will follow you around the house, helping you cook, do laundry, and even take a shower if you let them.
They also don’t like if their people are scattered through the house. 
 Most Corgis want everyone to be in one place at one time and may act anxious or unhappy if someone is upstairs and someone else is downstairs. 
  This behavior is common to many herding breeds and its intensity varies from individual to individual. 
 If your family likes to spend evenings scattered in different rooms, you may want to consider a different breed. 
                    <br>
                    Energy level varies widely between individual Corgis. 
                         All will need regular walks and some playtime and training to be happy.  Many Corgis need much more than that.  Some are almost impossible to tire out, and young Corgis (under 2) may never stop moving.  One of mine can go for a two-hour off-leash hike, take a thirty-minute power nap, and start dropping tennis balls at my feet to play.  Corgis like this need to learn some sort of “settle” or “enough” command or you won’t have any peace, and quite a few Corgis need a job (agility, herding, competition-level obedience) to be happy. 
                     Their bossiness (see below) and tendency to bark (see above) can make a Corgi with unspent energy very difficult to live with.
My own experience is with Pembrokes and my understanding is that Cardigans can be a little bit more laid-back in energy level.
